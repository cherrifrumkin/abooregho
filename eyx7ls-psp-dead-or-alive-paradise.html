Hello! I always had a problem with the type of video that guys like Sargon of Akkad and Thunderf00t usually make. You know the kind: very long, drawn out, filled with a lot of boring. One thing that I've noticed with these videos is how easy they can fall to actual scrutiny. Once you sit through them and debate them point by point, you basically understand that almost everything they say is bullshit. So I was really bored today and did just that, with this video called Social Justice Apolog. –û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ: Dead or Alive: Paradise –¥–µ–ª–∞–ª—Å—è —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ –¥–ª—è –∫–æ–Ω—Å–æ–ª–∏ PSP. –ì–∞—Ä–µ–º –∏–≥—Ä—ã Dead or Alive Paradise –Ω–∞—Å—á–∏—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –≤—Å–µ—Ö —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–µ–Ω—å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–µ–∫—Å–∞–ø–∏–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –±–æ–π—Ü–æ–≤.
